<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implants</li><li>Blink-assisted Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) devices market features two primary types: implants and blink-assisted devices. Implants are small devices surgically inserted into the eye to facilitate the outflow of aqueous humor, lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Blink-assisted devices, on the other hand, utilize the natural blinking mechanism to promote drainage and improve ocular health. Both types aim to deliver safer, minimally invasive options compared to traditional glaucoma surgeries, enhancing patient comfort and recovery times.</p></p>
